# ImageProcessing_GaussFiltering

% Add the following zero mean Gaussioan noises, seperately to red, green and blue channels of 256X256 lena image.
 
% Obtain gray scale images, I_1, I_5, I_10, I_20 by taking the average values of R,G,B channels corresponding to different noise levels.

% Filter these images by using low-pass filters with kernel.
    
% Filter the same images by using high-pass filters in this time.

% Inspect Figure-1. and comment on the type of noise and propose a method to de-noise the image.
